# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

jobs:
- job: A
  steps:
  - script: exit 1

- job: B
  dependsOn: A
  condition: failed()
  steps:
  - script: echo this will run when A fails

- job: C
  dependsOn:
  - A
  - B
  condition: succeeded('B')
  steps:
  - script: echo this will run when B runs and succeeds
